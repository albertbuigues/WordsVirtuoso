Game developed according to the Jetbrains Academy Project at the Kotlin Core course.

The objective of the game is to find the english 5-letter hidden word. If you match one letter in a correct position,
it's painted in green. If you find a letter in another position it's painted in yellow. In grey are painted letters that
are not present in the hidden word. Each round you can see in blue the letters that are not present and have been
already tested.
